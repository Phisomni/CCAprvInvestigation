# CCAprvInvestigation

The data used in this investigation came from Kaggle.com, originally taken from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal of this investigation was to discover which of these variables influence approval decisions the most, and in what ways they might be correlated with each other. Python data modeling techniques and several data-manipulation modules were used to search through the raw data and the application decisions associated with them.
